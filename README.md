# Sustainable cities – and why long paragraphs won’t help promote activism.
### Jakub Hojsan, DH110 UX+UI Design Portfolio DRAFT

### Introduction
Zero is a sustainable electric motorcycle platform whose goal it is to make commuting carbon neutral. The motivation laid in the fact that current sustainable city activism is all talk, with no real solutions being proposed/call to actions given.
### Design Statement
Some activist websites try to influence people to be more environmentally sustainable with long paragraphs explaining why to be more sustainable with little call to action. My goal was to create an application that would allow people to be more sustainable without thinking about it. Instead of informing like these sites were trying to do, try to garner actual impact with a platform.

Zero is able to do this, as it provides a method of being sustainable without pulling teeth, but rather having fun.
### Competitor Analysis
Before I came up with this idea, I really wanted to solve the problem of misinformation, as well as the problem of websies poorly displaying statistics with bad use of graphics and data visualization.

This could be seen in my [hueristic evaluation](https://github.com/JakubHojsan/DH110-22F/tree/main/A01) of a site that was blogging on ways cities themselves could be more sustainable. 

After evaluation hueristics, I found the space wouldn't be incredibley intellectually stimulating to iterate on, and I wanted to solve something really posing a problem to users.

I took a look at more sites like [Bird](https://www.bird.co/) and [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/scooters). This allowed me to find more gaps in competitors soltuion spaces, which can be found here at my [user testing](https://github.com/JakubHojsan/DH110-22F/tree/main/A02)
### User research
I needed to do some user research through [contextual inquiry] in order to pinpoint a solution space I wanted to work in through passive observation and interviews with users.
### UX storytelling 
My favorite part about user experience is the creation of unique [personas](https://github.com/JakubHojsan/DH110-22F/tree/main/A04) that would use the product. Here I created two personas with unique user journeys that roadmap how they would use Zero.

### Wireframe and graphic design element variation
During my [wireframing](https://github.com/JakubHojsan/DH110-22F/tree/main/A05) phase, I created a guide of what I wanted to pursue and pilot on my users. I zeroed in on certain tasks to design, and then made some [design variations](https://github.com/JakubHojsan/DH110-22F/tree/main/A06) to get the best combination of elements for my mockups.

### Low-fidelity prototype (wireflow, assignment06)
The low-fidelity prototyping phase allowed me to create a basic [wireflow](https://github.com/JakubHojsan/DH110-22F/tree/main/A05) and create some [interface design](https://github.com/JakubHojsan/DH110-22F/tree/main/A06) for it. These two elements allowed me to continue to the high-fidelity mockup.
### High-fidelity prototype (functional/interactive prototype, assignment08)
The [high-fidelity](https://www.figma.com/file/E0lVkbu4lQ9bkhfn0V9jZc/Zero?node-id=42%3A1823&t=CrtslYbsi4rHXwuF-1) prototype was the most stimulating thing to work on, after receiving all the inital feedback there was a great [prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/E0lVkbu4lQ9bkhfn0V9jZc/Zero?page-id=84%3A1701&node-id=84%3A1709&viewport=464%2C411%2C0.27&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=84%3A1704) I could continue testing.
### Optional evaluation and revision history 
Continuing this week.
### Pitch video 
Continuing this week.
### Conclusion: 
As my first endeavor into offical UI/UX, my conclusion must include that this work really pushed me further into a UI/UX/Product career.
