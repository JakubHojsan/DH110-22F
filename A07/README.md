# DH110 High-fidelity prototype

## What is the purpose of a high-fidelity prototype

The purpose of the high-fidelity prototype was to take the low-fidelity prototype and transform it into an interactive prototype one can interact with.

Zero is meant to be an application to rent electric motorcycles for short term and long term periods, hoping to contribute to the landscape of the sustainable city development goals posted by the United Nations. Electric motorcycles that the time (2022-2023) were not as accessible as an electric car. Following the lo-fi design, I added interactivity layers in Figma, as well as some animations :)

## Tasks that the prototype can handle

After the previous assignments, I had narrowed down usecases to these tasks:

- Being able to search for a location and route to it
- Changing your payment preference (miles versus hours)
- Select your prefered motorcycle
- View profile
