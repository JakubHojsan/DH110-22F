## Gestalt Theory

We group elements due to law of proximity, and law of similarity.

The only rule we break is intentional, subtext is used in a gutter since the sizing of the element is undersized compared to the element above it (the map.)

I see that evidence of the layout test with proper spacing is a point on the rubric, but this is a statement that it looks better without passing this part of the spacing test so I left it as is.

## Design Variations

### Font Variation
I stuck with Sans Serif font variations since I wanted the site to be more casual and more in touch with modern UI/UX frameworks. The three options look similar but all convey a casual design rather than a professional one as highlighted in a Serif font. For sizes and headings I used a framework called Nucleus and kept their default sizing for these elements and changed the text.
