## Welcome to my first assignment, heuristic evaluation. 

### Summary

During the course of this project I would like to highlight the best ways for people to contribute to developing a sustainable city, as well as imform the end user of what sustainable cities could look like in addition to their benefits. According to the United Nations, nearly half of the world's populations live in urban settings, with nearly sixty-percent living in these same areas by 2030.

Currently, sites that try to inform the user of what they can do/inform the user what sustainable cities are all about are verbose and lack conciseness. I hope to remedy this through rigorus analysis, and find ways to create my own design based on *Heuristic Evaluation*.

## Evaluation #1

### Background Information
The United Nations put out a list of sustainable goals to better our planet/humanity (both culturally and enviormentally.) While the site is the originator of these ideas does not mean the site is without flaw.

### Overall evaluation
Generally this is an _okay_ informational site. It has some missing and poor design elements hiding about, but it is expected for a nonprofit orginzation.
