# Assignment 5: Low Fidelity Mockup

### Jakub Hojsan, DH110 F22

## Brief Introduction

### Overview

The purpose of this low fidelity prototype is to ensure that the features proposed are navigated properly by the user, and to adjust expectations based on my target demographic.

### Tasks implemented

* Task 1: Find a nearby Zero motorcycle and route to a location.
* Task 2: Change the payment scheme from pay per hour to pay per mile and vice-versa.

### How were these features decided?

These basic features were decided by taking a look at similar commuter applications, as well as user feedback from assignment 3/4 one step up in this repository. 

### A brief preview of the wireframes.

## Participant Struggles

I noticed a few things when going through the UI/UX with my participant.
* The top search bar is the first thing she navigated to when I asked her to route herself to a location. I guess that the higher up the element is the higher precedent it has. 
* She thought the route me button allowed her to route her using the top search bar, when it was in fact a different element. This is something I didn't forsee.
* The back button at first may have indicated that she go back multiple steps, which is bad UI/UX practice.
