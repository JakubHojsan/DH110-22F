### Step 1: Specify the research goal & requirements

**What is the main activity your project would support for the users?**
>This project will help users live more sustainable lives, with a focus on alternative transport. Hopefully we will encourage more LA drivers to limit their use of gas operated cars to reduce traffic, as well as help them find resources to better their city by making it more sustainable.

>The main activity that the project would support for users is a version of a leasing software for sustainble vehicles, anything from electric scooters/motorcycles or even cars depending on the outcome of user observation.  

**What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?**
>The basic need involved with the activity is the goal to have LA citizens have healthier, less stressful, and sustainable lives in a sustainable LA.

**What are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
>Currently, traditional solutions include car rental apps like Turo, or rideshare platforms like Uber. Uber allows bike rental, as well as carpool and private cab. Other solutions exist like CityMapper, which allows you to sustainably route in certain cities using tram, bus, and even trains.

**What are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?**
>Some sites exist as well as apps that are components of more sustainable living (CityMapper is my favorite,) which highlights different ways to get to your destination via bike/bus/rideshare. The limitation is infrastructure, cities like LA were _built_ to be driven, so we must work around these limitations by providing solutions that use roads that are already built.

### Step 2: Identify target users

**What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)**
>The target user of our platform is the average LA commuter. Due to rising housing costs, commuters are pushed out of DLTA as well as other urbanized enviorments in LA and are forced to find routes close to an half and hour to work. _The average one-way commute in Los Angeles takes 30.9 minutes. That's longer than the US average of 26.4 minutes._ Sadly only 9 percent of people carpool, while nearly 70 percent drive to work alone.

>The issue with this is even with the creation of carpool lanes, LA commuter preference is to still drive alone. A solution that doesn't work must be iterated on, as the average LA resident is 35 years old, and need a simple solution to cut down on their commute, and be more sustainable. Less than 10% of LA residents commute on public transport, which is an issue. These numbers can be expanded if we learn more about what LA residents want, given their preferences above.

**In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity?**
>The utilization of an application to lease sustainable/subidized vehicles would at first glance be a one time use. This is obstenisbly incorrect, the platform would try to provide as much information to the user as possible in terms of service for their vehicles, commute information, and sustainability information to entice the user to use the platform (appeal to logic and emotion.)

**What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity?**
>Download the application, and take a quick quiz to see what lease would make most sense for them in terms of their commute. If it isn't a lease option but rather public transport, we would give them routes that they could take to work to be more sustainable/show statistics about the enviorment in terms of how much they have done for it.

### Step 3: Pick observation method(s)

> I utilized two observation methods: ethnographic research and participatory observation. 

The ethnographic research was simple, I went to the Big Blue Bus stop and asked people if there was an application or website they used to find routes and arrival times. The bulk majority of people using the stops here were students, which makes sense since we are on UCLAs campus. The two applications used were either Google maps which allows transit routing, or just the UCLA transport site which shows seasonal schedules on a pamphlet. 

The bus allegedly isn't free, but I observed that no one really paid for the bus. It seems like it is advertised as a paid service, but in reality is free. This is an interesting thing that I did not know before user research, and could've impacted my commutes on the hill to places like LAX and Santa Monica.

The CityMapper application is extremely useful in unknown cities, and was suprised no one was using it. It is extremley popular in the Bay Area and Stanford's campus, but historically Stanford is incredibley sustainable. Bikes everywhere, and trains and buses allow you to bring your bike on -- which lets you use the CityMapper app to bike to your stop and take your bike off and on to get to your next destination.

The participatroy observation research was with an individual that is under the age of the average LA resident commuter, but still has a commute in the LA area. The reasoning behind this is because a 35 year old may be less inclined to use an application to help them commute and it might be easier to learn from a millenial. The next section contains all materials used.
