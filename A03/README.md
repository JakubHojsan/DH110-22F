### Step 1: Specify the research goal & requirements

**What is the main activity your project would support for the users?**
>This project will help users live more sustainable lives, with a focus on alternative transport. Hopefully we will encourage more LA drivers to limit their use of gas operated cars to reduce traffic, as well as help them find resources to better their city by making it more sustainable.

>The main activity that the project would support for users is a version of a leasing software for sustainble vehicles, anything from electric scooters/motorcycles or even cars depending on the outcome of user observation.  

**What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?**
>The basic need involved with the activity is the goal to have LA citizens have healthier, less stressful, and sustainable lives in a sustainable LA.

**What are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
>Currently, the "traditional" solution are simply the informed. Bus routes can be confusing to use/not efficient, and the uneducated is the biggest hurdle towards a more sustainable LA. Other solutions exist like CityMapper, which allows you to sustainabley route in cities, and apps focused on the side of sustainablity like alternative power/solar. 

**What are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?**
>Some sites exist as well as apps that are components of more sustainable living (CityMapper is my favorite,) which highlights different ways to get to your destination via bike/bus/rideshare. These sites are fragmented into various realms of sustainablity, but I seek to design a platform that connects all these fragments to be the number one destination for sustainablity. 

### Step 2: Identify target users

**What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)**
>idk

**In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity?**
>idk

**What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity?**
>idk

### Step 3: Pick observation method(s)
