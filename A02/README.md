### User testing
thezebra.com is not a site dedicated to sustainable cites, but I found a topic within the site that had super insightful comments about sustainable cities. 

https://www.thezebra.com/resources/home/what-is-a-sustainable-city/

We will be performing a usability test for thezebra.com. The reasoning behind a usability test is to see how a site's interface is reacted to by an end user, and well as notice usability flaws. We record usability tests for general analysis of the users interaction with the site, showing us how to improve upon design.

For thezebra.com, I saw three problematic themes in the user experience
- User control and freedom
- Match between system and the real world
- Aesthetic and minimalist design

For my usability test, I simply used Zoom to record my participant while going through the survey with them.

The process of the usability test was as follows:
1. Introduction
2. Disclosure
3. Previous experience questions
4. Pre-test questions
5. Testing tasks
6. Post-test questions
7. SUS
8. Product satisfaction card
9. Demographics

The following results were measured (1-5 scale from Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree):
1. Ease of use
2. Frequency of use
3. Learning
4. Trustworthiness
5. Content
6. Honesty

## Improving user testing
The pilot test was incredibly frustrating. After three attempts I got a workable recording. I have learned a lot about the process. It came to my attention that the site had several inconsistencies in usability as well as honestly/trustworthy data. I learned that it is incredibly hard to naviagate their blog system dedicated to sustainable cities -- as it may be a small part of the site. The testing environment was hard to keep quiet due to a birthday ongoing, but we made it work :)

In future tests I would find a quieter area, as well as think of auxillary questions to ask beforehand that arent on the form to gauge what I am missing.
