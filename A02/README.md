### User testing
TheZebra.com is not a site dedicated to sustainable cites, but I found a topic within the site that had super insightful comments about sustainable cities. 

We will be performing a usability test for thezebra.com. The reasoning behind a usability test is to see how a site's interface is reacted to by an end user, and well as notice usability flaws. We record usability tests for general analysis of the users interaction with the site, showing us how to improve upon design.

For thezebra.com, I saw three problematic themes in the user experience
- User control and freedom
- Match between system and the real world
- Aesthetic and minimalist design

For my usability test, I simply used Zoom to record my participant while going through the survey with them.
